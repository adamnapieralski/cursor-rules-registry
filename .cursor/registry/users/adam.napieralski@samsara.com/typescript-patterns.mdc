# TypeScript Patterns

## Type Safety

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use union types for better type safety
- Avoid `any` type when possible

## Code Organization

- Use barrel exports for clean imports
- Group related functionality in modules
- Use consistent file naming conventions
- Separate concerns with proper abstractions

## Performance

- Use lazy loading for large components
- Implement proper memoization
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use React.memo for expensive components
