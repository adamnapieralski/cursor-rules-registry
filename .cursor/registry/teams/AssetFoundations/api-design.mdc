# API Design Patterns

## RESTful Principles

- Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Use consistent URL patterns
- Include proper error responses

## Request/Response Structure

- Use JSON for request/response bodies
- Include request ID in headers
- Use consistent field naming (snake_case)
- Include pagination for list endpoints

## Error Handling

- Return structured error responses
- Include error codes and messages
- Log errors with context
- Don't expose internal errors to clients
