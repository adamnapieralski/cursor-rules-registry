# Cursor Rules Registry Extension - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Build a Cursor extension that provides discoverability and management of Cursor rules across teams and users at Samsara. The extension will have a tabbed UI similar to Cursor Settings with Explore, Team, and Personal tabs.

**Deliverable**: Users can apply and remove rules with proper feedback.

---

### Step 3.2: Applied Rules UI Integration ‚úÖ
**Goal**: Show applied rules at the top of each tab with visual indicators.

**Tasks**:
- [x] Sort applied rules to the top of rule lists
- [x] Add green dot indicator for applied rules
- [x] Update UI refresh logic when applying/removing rules
- [x] Track active tab for proper UI updates

**Deliverable**: Applied rules are clearly visible at the top of each tab.

---

### Step 3.3: Fuzzy Search Implementation ‚úÖ
**Goal**: Add fuzzy search functionality to the Explore tab.

**Tasks**:
- [x] Implement fuzzy matching algorithm
- [x] Search across multiple fields (title, description, content, context, team, user)
- [x] Add debounced search input
- [x] Highlight matched terms in search results
- [x] Add content snippets showing matched parts
- [x] Implement scoring system for search results
